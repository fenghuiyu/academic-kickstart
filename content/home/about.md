# About me

I'm currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [department of Mathematics, the University of Hong Kong](http://www.math.hku.hk). My supervisor is Professor [Wai-Ki Ching](http://hkumath.hku.hk/~wkc/). 

In August of 2018, I graduated with PhD degree in Financial Mathematics from the University of Hong Kong. Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degrees in [Computational Mathematics](http://math.jlu.edu.cn/index.htm) and [Finance](http://jjxy.jlu.edu.cn/english/Faculty/Dept_of_Finance.htm) respectively from Jilin University, China in July of 2014. 

I've been doing research in the [Advanced Modeling and Applied Computing Laboratory at HKU](http://hkumath.hku.hk/~wkc/amacl.htm) with a focus in credit risk modeling and credit derivatives pricing, hidden Markov models, optimal pairs trading strategies and participating policies pricing via neural networks, etc.
